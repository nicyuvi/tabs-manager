# Tabs Manager Chrome Extension

## TODO

- [] PROBLEM: I want to be able to save all current tabs to a DB/spreadsheet/etc

## Things I learned

- [Collator](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/Collator) used to sort the tabs array by the user's preferred language
- [Template tag](https://web.dev/articles/webcomponents-template) used to define an HTML element that can be cloned instead of using
  `document.createElement()` to create each item
- [URL constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/URL) to create and parse URLS
